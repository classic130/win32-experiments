# Win32 Experiments

## Introduction

This repo is just to test out some experimental Win32 code. The code is mostly adapted from MSDN samples, with some minor changes and the occasional bugfix, as some MSDN samples do not even compile or have memory leaks. The code here is not production quality and may suffer from bugs or other issues, and there may be better ways of accomplishing the same functionality. This repo is merely intended to demonstrate and test general Win32 concepts and API use. Always review the relevant MSDN API entry for any hidden gotchas.
