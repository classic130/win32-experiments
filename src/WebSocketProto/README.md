# Win32 and Node.js WebSockets over protobuff

## Introduction

This sample demonstrates a Win32 WinHttp websocket communicating with a Node websocket server over protobuff. The message definition file is `testmessage.proto` and the autogenerated C++ and JS files were created using the protobuf compiler with the following commands: `.\protoc --cpp_out=. testmessage.proto` and `protoc --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:. testmessage.proto`. The Windows x64 protobuf compiler v3.11.4 `protoc.exe` is included in this example for convenience, but the compiler can also be downloaded from the [protobuf releases page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) on GitHub. The Node server for testing can be found in the `TestNodeServer` directory.
